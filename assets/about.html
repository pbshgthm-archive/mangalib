MangaLib is a personal project by me, to have a simple interface to read mangas online. It currently supports around 17,000 mangas. All the manga pages are hosted by mangaeden.com. I do not own any of the images hosted at the website. Enjoy reading.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></div>

<div class="about">
<br/><i><b>geeky note</b>: A python script downloads all the meta data from an API, parses it and downloads chapter data. After cleaning up broken links from API, json files with processed data is generated that is used by the javascript to render the mangas. All the images are hostedn at mangaedn's CDN, cdn.mangaeden.com. MangaLib uses 'localstorage' of the browser, so if you're concerned, do clean up localstorage under the key 'mangalib-manga'. As with any API, broken sources are present, and the best that I could do was display the classic "404". If you want the scripts, or find a bug, drop me a mail at <b>poobesh.g@gmail.com</b>.</i>
